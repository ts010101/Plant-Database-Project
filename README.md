Utilized HTML, CSS, Javascript, and SQL to complete this database project. Used MySQL/MariaDB as the database backend

The Database will serve an app focused on the hobby of gardening. The app will categorize up to 1,000 species of plants and their attributes. It will also focus on how plants change through different Months, Regions, and Environmental Factors. Each of these different entities will have various attributes that relate to the plant as well as each other. By looking at the different relationships between the database entities, we can provide valuable insights to our users. Additionally, providing information about how different months, regions, and environmental factors impact different plants can open the opportunity for further exploration regarding the topic of gardening as well as further possible research opportunities. The goal with this database is to provide factual, informative, and useful information to those who are interested in plant gardening. This database can even be utilized by different students to aid in their studies of plants or professors who are interested in researching plants.
